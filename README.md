  ## Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
``` 

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

  [Resistor Color Duo](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/resistor-color-duo)

  If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use resistors. For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

Each resistor has a resistance value.
Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values. Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!

The band colors are encoded as follows:
```
Black: 0
Brown: 1
Red: 2
Orange: 3
Yellow: 4
Green: 5
Blue: 6
Violet: 7
Grey: 8
White: 9
```
From the example above: brown-green should return 15 brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.
