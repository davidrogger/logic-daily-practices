When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. For example:

PDF-highighting.png

There is a list of  character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index  and 'z' is at index . There will also be a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in  assuming all letters are  wide.

Example
```
h = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
word = ' torn'
```

The heights are t = 2, o = 1, r = 1 and n = 1. The tallest letter is `2` high and there are 4 letters. The hightlighted area will be `2 * 4 = 8mm²` so the answer is `8`.
